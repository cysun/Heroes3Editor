# Heroes of Might and Magic 3 (HoMM3) Savegame Editor

Well, I want to learn Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) by doing a project, and I recently
got back into playing HoMM3 after discovering the wonderful
[HoMM3 HD Mod](https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/). With all the real-life responsibilities
these days, I can no longer bear the tedious part of the game, thus this savegame editor to make it
a little easier.
